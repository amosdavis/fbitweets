# fbitweets
It's not my wifi name. I want to find out which FBI field offices have quantum entanglement military gear wound around them in such a way that they dogpile anyone who @'mentions them telling them something is bad!

How it's going to work.
1) I am going to schedule tweets to each FBI twitter handle that I've found.  I am going to schedule them about 3 days apart.
2) Local authorities will get a phone call telling them that a guy named Drake is harassing people or threatening them.  There may be other content to those phone calls, but it will be enough to get them out and tailing me around.
3) This repository is supposed to look stupid and be dumb.  I shouldn't need to program this, so I'm going to just slap a shell script together probably using at.  Anyone. could. have. done. this.

#Ok,  here it seems to have installed the 'twitter' python application.  This is cool.
#Rainbowstream wants to suck you in and make you not use the CLI directly
twitter set #This command sets my status!
